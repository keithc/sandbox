					<article>So sentimental, not sentimental no<br>
					Romantic not disgusting yet<br>
					Darling, I'm down and lonely when with the fortunate only<br>
					I've been looking for something else<br>
					Do let, do let, do let, jugulate, do let, do let, do<br>
					<br>
					Let's go slowly discouraged<br>
					Distant from other interests on your favorite weekend ending<br>
					This love's for gentlemen only that's with the fortunate only<br>
					No, I gotta be someone else<br>
					These days it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes and goes<br>
					<br>
					Lisztomania<br>
					Think less but see it grow like a riot, like a riot, oh<br>
					I'm not easily offended<br>
					It's not hard to let it go from a mess to the masses<br>

					Think less but see it grow like a riot, like a riot, oh<br>
					I'm not easily offended<br>
					It's not hard to let it go from a mess to the masses<br>
					<br>
					Follow, misguide, stand still<br>
					Disgust, discourage on this precious weekend ending<br>
					This love's for gentlemen only, wealthiest gentlemen only<br>
					And now that you're lonely<br>
					Do let, do let, do let, jugulate, do let, do let, do<br>
					<br>
					Let's go slowly discouraged, we'll burn the pictures instead<br>
					When it's all over we can barely discuss<br>
					For one minute only, not with the fortunate only<br>
					Thought it could have been something else<br>
					These days it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes and goes<br>

					This is show time, this is show time, this is show time<br>
					This is show time, this is show time, this is show time<br>
